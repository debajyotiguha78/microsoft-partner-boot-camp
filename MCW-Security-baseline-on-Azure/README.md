# Security baseline on Azure

Contoso Ltd is a multinational corporation, headquartered in the United States that provides insurance solutions worldwide. Its products include accident and health insurance, life insurance, travel, home, and auto coverage. Contoso manages data collection services by sending mobile agents directly to the insured to gather information as part of the data collection process for claims from an insured individual. These mobile agents are based all over the world and are residents of the region in which they work. Mobile agents are managed remotely through regional corporate offices.

They are exploring a mainly lift and shift strategy but do have some non-mission critical SQL databases they would like moved to Azure.  For each workload, they are looking for guidance on Azure Security and Privacy features.
